               Projecting species distributions under climate change requires going beyond climate suitability models. We propose that metapopulation theory can be used to leverage species distribution models while accounting for landscape spatial structure, biotic interactions and demography. While reviewing how metapopulation theory reacts to climate-induced distribution shifts, we found that habitat-climate mismatch can generate non-equilibrium dynamics, linear change in habitat occupancy generates non-linear distribution change, and the effect of environmental change on habitat can have counterintuitive effects on higher trophic levels. We illustrated our findings by developing habitat suitability models for the Bicknell’s Thrush (<em>Catharus bicknelli</em>) a red-listed bird species confined to perturbed balsam fir forests. Under climate warming, the Bicknell’s Thrush distribution shifts northwards from the effect of climate alone while the distribution of its associated vegetation remains stable despite warming. The arising mismatch between climate and vegetation changes patch size, connectivity, and habitat structure potentially to different extent, influencing species persistence and suggesting that habitat alone is not enough to characterize regional distribution changes. Our results emphasize the importance of both habitat and landscape spatial structure in assessing persistence for which metapopulation theory is an ideal framework to further advance our understanding of species distribution.

         <p>Climate change has already prompted species to shift their range toward higher latitudes and elevations <span class="citation" data-cites="parmesan_ecological_2006 chen_rapid_2011 virkkala_patterns_2014">(Parmesan <a href="#ref-parmesan_ecological_2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>; Chen et al. <a href="#ref-chen_rapid_2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>; Virkkala and Lehikoinen <a href="#ref-virkkala_patterns_2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. Species persistence in response to climate change may critically depend on their ability to expand their range and track suitable environments. While most current predictive approaches ignore important biological mechanisms such as demography, dispersal, and biotic interactions, these play key roles in species response to environmental change <span class="citation" data-cites="urban_improving_2016">(Urban et al. <a href="#ref-urban_improving_2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>.

         <p>Another approach recently proposed is derived from metapopulation theory.

The environment may constrain these two processes and limit metapopulation persistence. Distribution limits eventually emerge over environmental gradients at this location where persistence becomes critical. Furthermore, distributions may be constrained by the amount of suitable conditions in a region. As a result, a species may be absent from a region, or a portion of a gradient, despite the occurrence of suitable conditions if these are not abundant enough or if extinction is too high. Metapopulation theory also makes an ideal framework to incorporate several elements of complexity such as landscape heterogeneity, dispersal, and biotic interactions as it is flexible enough to integrate fundamental processes driving distribution dynamics.</p>
         <p>Disturbances, environmental changes, and biotic interactions are processes that may cause species distribution to be constantly out of equilibrium with their niche <span class="citation" data-cites="ovaskainen_transient_2002 svenning_influence_2014 boulangeat_transient_2018">(Ovaskainen and Hanski <a href="#ref-ovaskainen_transient_2002" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>; Svenning et al. <a href="#ref-svenning_influence_2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>; Boulangeat et al. <a href="#ref-boulangeat_transient_2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.

         <p>In this paper, we show how metapopulation theory can be used to model and thus complement the interpretation of species distribution in a changing environment. In addition, we illustrate how metapopulation theory can be used to leverage species distribution models by accounting for the complexity arising from biotic interactions, demography, and landscape structure. After reviewing the theory to account for these key ecological processes in distribution modelling and present associated sources of complexity, we illustrate the effect and importance of these processes on persistence and distribution dynamics using the Bicknell’s Thrush (<em>Catharus bicknelli</em>), a red-listed bird species, as a case study <span class="citation" data-cites="iucn_catharus_2020">(IUCN <a href="#ref-iucn_catharus_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</p>

         <h2 id="model-description">Model description</h2>
         <p>The classic metapopulation model describes species distribution over a set of suitable patches of habitat connected by dispersal <span class="citation" data-cites="levins_demographic_1969 levins_mathematical_1970">(Levins <a href="#ref-levins_demographic_1969" role="doc-biblioref">1969</a>, <a href="#ref-levins_mathematical_1970" role="doc-biblioref">1970</a>)</span>. Regional dynamics are driven by colonization and extinction events, which corresponding rates depend on local environmental conditions. Together they define the species distribution limits. The dynamics may be complexified with the representation of several trophic levels, where high-trophic level species occur exclusively at locations occupied by lower-level species <span class="citation" data-cites="fordham_adapted_2013">(Fordham et al. <a href="#ref-fordham_adapted_2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>. We adopt the specialist-habitat terminology throughout this study to lighten the text and fit the example, even if the results are more general and can apply to any bottom-up system (e.g., predator-prey or host-mutualist).</p>
         <p>Consider a simplistic system composed of a specialist species tracking the spatial distribution of a dynamic favourable habitat, such as a particular type of vegetation patch providing shelter and food. The model represents the dynamics of the occupancy of three possible states: empty, occupied by the favourable habitat alone (<span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>) or in co-occurrence with the specialist (<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>). The landscape is heterogeneous and each local patch is characterized by the abiotic environmental condition (<span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>). Dynamics of occupancy are given by the following system of differential equations:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[
         \frac{dH(E)}{dt} = c_{H}(E)H(1-H) - e_{H}(E)H
         \]</span></p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[
         \frac{dS(E)}{dt} = c_{S}(E)S(H(E)-S) - e_{S}(E)S
         \]</span></p>
         <p>Where <span class="math inline">\(c(E)\)</span> is the function for colonization rate and <span class="math inline">\(e(E)\)</span> for the extinction rate. Both are species-specific functions of the abiotic environment such that <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> also depend on <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, the abiotic environmental conditions. A specialist persists over the landscape in a dynamic equilibrium between habitat availability (i.e., habitat occupancy over the landscape), colonization, and extinction if its occupancy <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is larger than zero:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[
         S(E^{*}) = H(E^{*}) - \frac{e_{S}(E^{*})}{c_{S}(E^{*})}
         \]</span></p>
         <p>and the distribution limit is defined by <span class="math inline">\(S(E^{*}) = 0\)</span>, such that it is located where <span class="math inline">\(H(E^{*}) = \frac{e_{S}(E^{*})}{c_{S}(E^{*})}\)</span>. Distribution limits of a habitat specialist are therefore determined by its intrinsic response to the abiotic environment (the ratio <span class="math inline">\(\frac{e_{S}(E)}{c_{S}(E)}\)</span>), in conjunction with the habitat response to the abiotic environment (<span class="math inline">\(\frac{e_{H}(E)}{c_{H}(E)}\)</span>).</p>
         <h2 id="graphical-representation-of-range-limits">Graphical representation of range limits</h2>
         <p>We provide three examples to illustrate how metapopulation theory can reveal some of the complexities of distribution dynamics under a changing climate.</p>
         <p>A specialist’s persistence and therefore occupancy is jointly affected by environmental conditions and habitat availability (occupancy) such that it can be represented graphically with <span class="math inline">\(\frac{e(E)}{c(E)}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H(E)\)</span> curves (Figure <a href="#fig:occ_plot">1</a>). Distribution limit occurs at the position along the environmental gradient where the habitat occupancy curve crosses the extinction to colonization ratio. The specialist’s occupancy for given environmental conditions is defined by the difference between habitat availability and the extinction to colonization ratio curves (<span class="math inline">\(S^{*} = H-\frac{e}{c}\)</span>). The difference between habitat availability and the extinction to colonization ratio curves (<span class="math inline">\(S^{*}\)</span>; shown by the arrows in Figure <a href="#fig:occ_plot">1</a> A) is reduced with increasing environmental conditions, illustrating a decrease in the specialist’s occupancy and persistence (<span class="math inline">\(S(E_{0}^{*}) &gt; S(E_{1}^{*})\)</span>).</p>

         <p>In a bottom-up system such as predator-prey or a habitat specialist, the response to environmental change does not only depend on the focal species but also on the response of the associated one. The covariation in the response to the environment between the two levels is therefore of critical importance. For instance, the net effect of less favourable environmental conditions to a specialist could be detrimental (Figure <a href="#fig:occ_plot">1</a> A), without effect (Figure <a href="#fig:occ_plot">1</a> B), or favourable (Figure <a href="#fig:occ_plot">1</a> C) depending on the effect of the environment to its habitat. Thus, the interaction between trophic levels may have indirect (and counterintuitive) effects on specialist response.</p>

         <p>Range limits of a habitat specialist is jointly affected by environmental conditions and the availability (occupancy) of its habitat. Range shift in response to environmental changes is therefore not only determined by its intrinsic response to the environment, but also by the response of the habitat to the environment. As a result, a mismatch between the species response to the environment and its realized distribution may arise, in particular when different trophic levels are not responding at the same rate to environmental change (Figure <a href="#fig:concept_mismatch">2</a>). The distribution may shift in the geographic space, for instance toward the north, but it should stay the same in the environmental space if both levels respond similarly (Figure <a href="#fig:concept_mismatch">2</a>, dark shaded area). That said, if a delay or any other factor prevents the habitat from tracking the new environmental conditions, then the habitat curve will shift (Figure <a href="#fig:concept_mismatch">2</a>, green dashed line), and so will the distribution limit (light shaded area). Such mismatch could either benefit or harm the specialist distribution; in Figure <a href="#fig:concept_mismatch">2</a>, the specialist expands to less favourable environmental conditions. The response of the habitat to changing environmental conditions does influence the specialist distribution, both in extent and in the position of its distribution limits in environmental and geographical space.</p>

         <p>The projection of range shifts with correlative SDMs assumes an instantaneous response to environmental change. An implicit assumption is also that a reduction in habitat occupancy translates into an equivalent reduction in the specialist’s range, leading to extinction <span class="citation" data-cites="thomas_extinction_2004">(Thomas et al. <a href="#ref-thomas_extinction_2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span>. Metapopulation dynamics may, however, precipitate the decline of a species before the complete disappearance of suitable conditions. Consider a landscape where environmental conditions are spatially heterogeneous, such as temperature in a mountainous area. The progressive change in this environment, like climate warming, will have two effects on the distribution of suitable patches: the first direct consequence is a reduction in habitat occupancy <span class="math inline">\(H(E)\)</span>, and indirectly follows the increase of the extinction rate with the shrinking of suitable patches. Some favourable patches may also disappear, thereby reducing the landscape connectivity. A non-linear decline of occupancy therefore arises from a linear change in environmental conditions as the ratio <span class="math inline">\(\frac{e(E)}{c(E)}\)</span> within the specialist’s persistence function increases (Figure <a href="#fig:concept_metapop">3</a>). This metapopulation effect may not be important at first while suitable habitat is abundant and patches are large, but increases as habitat occupancy decreases, supporting an acceleration of metapopulation prevalence loss to a constant environmental environmental shift <span class="citation" data-cites="hanski_metapopulation_2000 ovaskainen_transient_2002">(Hanski and Ovaskainen <a href="#ref-hanski_metapopulation_2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>; Ovaskainen and Hanski <a href="#ref-ovaskainen_transient_2002" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span>.</p>
         <h2 id="spatially-explicit-landscapes">Spatially explicit landscapes</h2>
         <p>Analytical tools from metapopulation theory can be used to interpret range limits in spatially explicit heterogeneous landscapes. Metapopulation capacity can be evaluated for realistic landscapes where patch coordinates and size are considered. Metapopulation capacity is measured as the first eigenvalue of the landscape matrix <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, where elements <span class="math inline">\(m_{ij} = exp(-\alpha d_{ij})A_{i}A_{j}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(j \neq i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m_{ii} = 0\)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="hanski_metapopulation_2000">(Hanski and Ovaskainen <a href="#ref-hanski_metapopulation_2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\alpha}\)</span> describes the average dispersal distance, <span class="math inline">\(d_{ij}\)</span> is the distance between patch <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(A_{i}\)</span> is the area of patch <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> (refer to <span class="citation" data-cites="hanski_metapopulation_2000">Hanski and Ovaskainen (<a href="#ref-hanski_metapopulation_2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>)</span> for the full description). Metapopulation capacity is a measure of a species’ ability to maintain itself regionally as a function of connectivity and local extinctions. It provides the means to evaluate conditions for persistence given the spatial arrangement of patches and their size.</p>
         <p>Climate change can profoundly alter landscapes as experienced by species; not only does it influence the amount of suitable habitats, but also the capacity of species to persist when colonization and extinction prevail. Consider a mountainous landscape inhabited by a high elevation habitat specialist. The landscape is marked by a steep elevational gradient in temperature where warm temperatures at low elevations exceed the species’ tolerance. The landscape would therefore be divided between suitable cold habitats on mountain tops and unsuitable warmer habitats at the bottom. The topography will not only determine the total surface of suitable conditions, but also the frequency distribution of patch sizes and of distances among mountain tops. As a result, it will influence the connectivity of the landscape and the distribution of patch specific extinction rates.</p>
         <p>A schematic example is provided in Figure <a href="#fig:concept_metapop_structure">4</a>, inspired by the case study that will follow in the next section. Fixing a lower climatic range limit in a hypothetical mountainous landscape, we find nine suitable habitat patches of various sizes, distributed at various distances one from another (Figure <a href="#fig:concept_metapop_structure">4</a>, left panel). Habitat patches here represent high elevation mountain tops. The warming of climatic conditions causes an elevational shift of lower range limits resulting in the contraction of habitat patches and a decline in the number of patches (Figure <a href="#fig:concept_metapop_structure">4</a>, right panel). Patches become generally smaller from contraction and fragmentation, and the smallest patches go extinct. Further, not only smaller patches are assumed to support smaller population sizes, have superior extinction risks, and produce fewer colonizers <span class="citation" data-cites="hanski_metapopulation_2000">(Hanski and Ovaskainen <a href="#ref-hanski_metapopulation_2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>)</span>, but the loss and the fragmentation of patches alter species dispersal ability through the loss of connectivity <span class="citation" data-cites="huang_using_2019">(Huang, Pimm, and Giri <a href="#ref-huang_using_2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>.</p>
         <p>The decrease in metapopulation capacity surpasses that of habitat amount, adding a spatial structure perspective to the assumptions made by correlative approaches. The overall effect of climate warming is not only to modify patch areas, but to change species’ ability to colonize and occupy these patches.</p>

         <p>In the following section, we project the changes to the Bicknell’s Thrush breeding range in response to climate forcing using a standard correlative approach. We then leverage the projections using the concepts developed to analyze the total amount of favourable habitat, the distribution of patch areas, their connectivity, and the metapopulation capacity. Finally, we compare Bicknell’s Thrush favourable landscapes under climate-only change and climate-induced forest change scenarios to illustrate arising climate-habitat mismatch. Thereby, we wish to reveal the joint effects of these two components of Bicknell’s Thrush’s distribution and demonstrate their importance on distribution dynamics.</p>

         <h3 id="studied-region">Studied region</h3>
         <p>The Bicknell’s Thrush breeding range was projected for the province of Québec where the majority of the Canadian occurrences are found, specifically in the Appalachian Mountains in the southeast and the Laurentians Mountains north of the St. Lawrence River <span class="citation" data-cites="cosewic_cosewic_2022 billerman_bicknells_2020">(COSEWIC <a href="#ref-cosewic_cosewic_2022" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>; Townsend et al. <a href="#ref-billerman_bicknells_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>. The landscape is composed of boreal, mixed and temperate forests, with their distributions mainly driven by climatic latitudinal and elevational gradients. Mean annual temperature ranges from -4.0 to 7.5 °C in this region, but the Bicknell’s Thrush occupies locations with a more restricted range because of its preference for high-elevation areas. Annual precipitation ranges from 730 to 950 mm.</p>

         <p>Distribution data consisted of 6,079 confirmed observations of nesting behavior, with geographic precision to ~30 m (1 second of latitude/longitude), sampled from 1994 to 2020.

The region of interest was rasterized on a grid of 250 x 250 m cells, where an observation within a cell was defined as a presence. We considered the locations where one or more observations were made as a single presence, accounting for any potential effects of temporal and spatial pseudo-replication resulting, for example, from multiple sightings of the one individual in the same location.</p>

The effect is similar to applying a spatial scaling so that the response is modelled as the number of observations per cell.</p>

         <h3 id="scenarios">Scenarios</h3>
         <p>We projected the Bicknell’s thrush breeding range for two scenarios to contrast the impacts of climate with forest composition dynamics over the 2020-2100 period.</p>
         <p>The Bicknell’s Thrush breeding range distribution was first projected over time using the RCP 4.5 climate forcing scenario <span class="citation" data-cites="van_vuuren_representative_2011">(van Vuuren et al. <a href="#ref-van_vuuren_representative_2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>, while keeping forest composition and elevation constant. Future temperature and precipitation projections for 2021-2040, 2041-2070 and 2071-2100 periods were obtained for the RCP 4.5 scenario from the Canadian Earth System Model version 2 (CanESM2). Such anthropogenic climate forcing is increasingly considered as one of the most likely scenarios given current and pledged global climate policies <span class="citation" data-cites="hausfather_emissions_2020">(Hausfather and Peters <a href="#ref-hausfather_emissions_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>. Projections were first downscaled to a 10 km resolution using the ANUSPLIN method, and then the BioSIM v11 model was used to interpolate them to a 250 m resolution <span class="citation" data-cites="regniere_stochastic_2007 mckenney_customized_2011">(R’egni‘ere and St-Amant <a href="#ref-regniere_stochastic_2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>; McKenney et al. <a href="#ref-mckenney_customized_2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>. As BioSIM stochastically generate future daily weather time series using 30-yrs future climate normals, we averaged results from 30 BioSIM simulations to compute future climate variables that were assigned to the last year of the projection period (e.g., 2021-2040 period became 2040).</p>
         <p>Second, we projected Bicknell’s Thrush breeding range over time by only considering climate-induced changes in forest composition (hereafter forest change) under RCP 4.5, i.e., keeping climate variables and elevation constant in the model. Projections of forest composition for the commercial forests of Québec in 2040, 2070, and 2100 were obtained from <span class="citation" data-cites="boulanger_boreal_2021">Boulanger and Pascual Puigdevall (<a href="#ref-boulanger_boreal_2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> which were produced using the LANDIS-II forest landscape model <span class="citation" data-cites="scheller_design_2007">(FLM, Scheller et al. <a href="#ref-scheller_design_2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span>.

         <h3 id="analyses">Analyses</h3>
         <p>We assessed the impacts of climate-only change and forest change on Bicknell’s Thrush persistence by contrasting different aspects of landscape structure from the original and forecasted landscapes. Analyses were run for the southern part of the Québec Province. Breeding range may change with respect to habitat occupancy (here, fir-stand occupancy), the spatial structure of suitable patches, or the species’ ability to occupy available suitable patches. Isolating the effect of these different elements helps to identify the drivers and their respective importance on distribution dynamics. We decomposed the landscape spatial structure into three complementary elements: the number of patches, the patch areas, and the inter-patch distances.</p>
         <p>We further compared temporal trends in habitat amount <span class="citation" data-cites="fahrig_rethinking_2013">(sensu Fahrig <a href="#ref-fahrig_rethinking_2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> and persistence using metapopulation capacity <span class="citation" data-cites="hanski_spatially_2001">(Hanski <a href="#ref-hanski_spatially_2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span>. We contrasted habitat amount, metapopulation capacity without dispersal constraints, and metapopulation capacity with strong dispersal constraints to reveal how accounting for metapopulation dynamics can better inform us on the Bicknell’s Thrush distribution as discussed in section 2. Note that because we do not have a good knowledge of the Bicknell’s Thrush dispersal kernel, we therefore compared metapopulation capacity for extreme scenarios of dispersal within the range of plausible kernels. We thus evaluated metapopulation capacity for high dispersal limitations (average dispersal distance of 1 km) and for long average dispersal distance (average dispersal distance of 500 km).</p>
         <h2 id="results-connectivity-in-addition-to-habitat-amount-define-realized-range">Results: Connectivity in addition to habitat amount define realized range</h2>
         <p>The model had high performance and accurate breeding range prediction with an AUC of 0.95. Proportional fir biomass (slope ± standard error, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_6 = 3.39 \pm 0.46\)</span>) and mean annual temperature (<span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 = 1.56 \pm 0.27\)</span>) are best predictors of the breeding range. Furthermore, the quadratic temperature term is significantly negative (<span class="math inline">\(\beta_2 = -0.28 \pm 0.025\)</span>) such that the model estimates maximum occupancy at 2.7 Celsius (mean annual temperature). Total annual precipitation (<span class="math inline">\(\beta_3 = -0.0064 \pm 0.00024\)</span>) and elevation (<span class="math inline">\(\beta_4 = 0.018 \pm 0.00029\)</span>) also have significant effects on occupancy. Fir biomass was not a significant predictor (<span class="math inline">\(\beta_5 = 0.0082 \pm 0.0081\)</span>) but its interactions with fir relative abundance (<span class="math inline">\(\beta_7 = -0.048 \pm 0.012\)</span>) and proportional fir biomass were such that stands of dense fir forest are associated with greater occupancy. The model shows a decrease in Bicknell’s thrush predicted occupancy at low elevations of the southern and the northern edge of its distribution area (Figure <a href="#fig:map_BITH">5</a>).</p>

         <h3 id="climate-and-habitat-mismatch">Climate and habitat mismatch</h3>
         <p>Our model projected varying effects of climate change on Bicknell’s Thrush breeding range within the study region (Figure <a href="#fig:map_BITH">5</a>). The magnitude of change differed between climate-only and climate-induced forest change scenarios. Shifts at the range edges were more pronounced than within the range under the climate-only scenario, with contraction at the southern edge and expansion at the northern edge. Under the climate-only scenario, extensive expansion was projected as soon as 2040 at high elevation (&gt;600 m) and in rapidly warming (up to 3 °C between 2020 and 2040) regions. Multiple northward patches became momentarily suitable with climate warming at moderate elevation areas (500 to 600 m) because of the narrow range of suitable climatic conditions at these lower elevations. Important contraction was projected at the southern range edge with high elevation mountain tops insufficient to cope with temperature increase. Conversely, changes in forest composition are limited due to the slow demography and the limited dispersal of trees <span class="citation" data-cites="vissault_slow_2020">(Vissault et al. <a href="#ref-vissault_slow_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>. As a result, the projected changes to the breeding range under the forest change scenario were much more limited (Figure <a href="#fig:map_BITH">5</a>).</p>
         <h3 id="changes-in-the-spatial-structure">Changes in the spatial structure</h3>
         <p>Projections show that climate and forest changes have major consequences on the spatial structure of suitable patches (Figure <a href="#fig:persistence">6</a>, Suppl. Mat. S1). The number of patches within the breeding range in the climate-only scenario supports the initial observation of range expansion followed by a rapid contraction with a peak in number of patches in 2040, while the forest change scenario shows a decline in number of patches. Overall, median patch area for both scenarios varied between 0.125 and 0.312 <span class="math inline">\(km^2\)</span> (minimum and maximum patch area = 0.0625 and 7805 <span class="math inline">\(km^2\)</span> respectively) and indicates a skewed distribution with a dominance of small patches and few very large ones. On the other hand, the median inter-patch distance varied between 218 and 280 km (minimum and maximum inter-patch distance = 0.25 and 809 km respectively) and shows a more balanced distribution with the landscape composed of distanced groups of regionally close patches. Although the distribution of patch areas in the climate-only scenario appears to remain constant through time, important decreases in the interpatch distances indicate the loss of small, isolated patches, the addition of geographically close patches, and the fragmentation of large patches. Despite the apparent stability of the breeding range under the climate-induced forest change scenario, important changes in its spatial structure were observed (Figure <a href="#fig:persistence">6</a>). We observed a rapid decline in the number of patches and, in contrast to changes under the climate-only scenario, the median patch area constantly increased between 2020 and 2100, and the inter-patch distance marginally increased. Results indicate that close patches became connected to form fewer, but larger patches in addition to the loss of small, isolated patches (Suppl. Mat. S1).</p>

         <p>We observed an initial increase of 64% (11,743 to 19,344 <span class="math inline">\(km^2\)</span>) in habitat amount under the climate-only scenario (total change of +9% between 2020 and 2100; Figure <a href="#fig:persistence">6</a> A, full blue line) while habitat amount remained almost stable with only a slight initial decrease of 11% (11,742 to 10,416 <span class="math inline">\(km^2\)</span>) under the climate-induced forest change scenario (total change of -15% between 2020 and 2100; Figure <a href="#fig:persistence">6</a> B, full orange line). Changes in Bicknell’s Thrush metapopulation capacity approximated those in habitat amount under long average dispersal distance (approximating mean field assumption, Figure <a href="#fig:persistence">6</a>). However, metapopulation persistence accounting for patch size alone (long-distance dispersal) was closely approximated by habitat amount but differed when accounting for both patch size and connectivity (limited dispersal) when changes in the spatial structure of the breeding range were not explained by habitat amount alone.</p>
         <h1 id="perspectives">Perspectives</h1>
         <p>Using theory and a case study, we show that the climate-induced changes in distribution are likely to be impacted by bottom-up interactions, demography, and landscape structure. We first derived three observations from metapopulation theory. i) A specialist’s range is impacted by changes in habitat occupancy and a habitat-environment mismatch affects the range limits of the specialist. ii) The interplay between habitat shrinking and connectivity loss is likely to yield precipitated range contraction and could potentially lead to extinction. iii) The direction and amplitude of the specialist’s response to environmental change vary with the degree of environmental response correlation between trophic levels. We projected the suitable environmental conditions for a well-known bird species whose distribution is jointly affected by climate and vegetation and we analyzed its spatial structure. We showed that climate-induced changes to the distribution of suitable climatic conditions differed from that of its biotic habitat. Furthermore, both the amount of habitat and the spatial structure distribution of the favourable environmental and biotic conditions are predicted to be impacted by climate change. Thus, we expect the persistence of this species under climate change to be fundamentally affected by metapopulation dynamics. We show that the metapopulation approach complements the understanding of distribution changes by correlative SDMs. The metapopulation dynamics are fundamental to account for changes in distributions’ spatial structure and contribute to accurately capturing climate-induced change in species distribution.</p>
         <h2 id="applications-of-the-metapopulation-approach">Applications of the metapopulation approach</h2>
         <p>Many studies have investigated distribution change using metapopulation theory <span class="citation" data-cites="fordham_adapted_2013 schnell_estimating_2013 talluto_extinction_2017 huang_using_2019 vissault_slow_2020">(Fordham et al. <a href="#ref-fordham_adapted_2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>; Schnell et al. <a href="#ref-schnell_estimating_2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>; Talluto et al. <a href="#ref-talluto_extinction_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>; Huang, Pimm, and Giri <a href="#ref-huang_using_2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>; Vissault et al. <a href="#ref-vissault_slow_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>, but few have considered the complexity arising from biotic interactions and dispersal in context of rapid environmental change. Some aspects have, however, been explored, starting with the development of the theoretical basis for metapopulation dynamics on heterogeneous landscapes. Spatially realistic metapopulation theory has allowed modelling of distribution dynamics in species living in fragmented landscapes <span class="citation" data-cites="hanski_metapopulation_1998 hanski_habitat_1999 hanski_spatially_2001">(Hanski <a href="#ref-hanski_metapopulation_1998" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>, <a href="#ref-hanski_habitat_1999" role="doc-biblioref">1999</a>, <a href="#ref-hanski_spatially_2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span>.

Our analysis reveals distribution dynamics that previous methods fail to capture, demonstrating the importance of integrating dynamic processes. The metapopulation framework that we propose here proposes to simultaneously project changes in demography and dispersal in response to climate change and the multi-species effects of biotic interactions on the distribution of species.</p>
         <p>Metapopulation theory and models influence how conservation priorities are defined at various scales today. Metapopulation theory predicts the scaling of extinction risk with increasing habitat isolation, which non-spatially explicit approaches do not consider. We further show that a species’ ability to access suitable habitat is a determining factor of its persistence. Assisted colonization and habitat restoration are proposed as means to support species persistence by increasing colonization rates and habitat occupancy, respectively <span class="citation" data-cites="ricciardi_assisted_2009 willis_assisted_2009 fordham_adapted_2013">(Ricciardi and Simberloff <a href="#ref-ricciardi_assisted_2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>; Willis et al. <a href="#ref-willis_assisted_2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>; Fordham et al. <a href="#ref-fordham_adapted_2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>. Ultimately, metapopulation theory’s main contribution to current conservation initiatives has been to highlight the effect of landscape spatial structure and dispersal on species persistence.</p>
         <h2 id="metapopulation-dynamics">Metapopulation dynamics</h2>
         <p>We have shown using a metapopulation approach that a change in the occupancy of a habitat along an abiotic environmental gradient may impact the distribution of higher levels, such as predators or, here, habitat specialists. Therefore, a mismatch between the distribution of the habitat and of the favourable environmental conditions may affect the position of the specialist’s range edge along an environmental gradient. This is the result of local increases or decreases in colonization and extinction rates from changes in habitat occupancy. Indeed, we observed the Bicknell’s Thrush breeding range projection from climate-induced forest change to remain stable despite important climate change. Less contraction than expected from climate-only projections were observed at the warm edge of southern local habitat patches, indicating the establishment of a mismatch. The high elevation coniferous patches persisted into warmer conditions, increasing fir occupancy under environmental conditions where it was previously rare or absent. Furthermore, we observed no range expansion of the specialist where the climate-only scenario predicts northern expansion, revealing a decrease in habitat occupancy for climatic conditions where it was previously available. This observation is likely the result of prolonged persistence (i.e., extinction debt) of the Bicknell’s Thrush where it is already observed despite less favourable environmental conditions, and the reduction of occupancy in favourable environmental conditions where it is initially observed (i.e., colonization credit). As a result, non-equilibrium dynamics in Bicknell’s Thrush distribution change are predicted to be an important source of complexity. Forested habitat-environment, or resource-environment mismatch in response to environmental change is to be expected in natural systems from limitations in dispersal ability and demography <span class="citation" data-cites="svenning_influence_2014">(Svenning et al. <a href="#ref-svenning_influence_2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. Conversely, habitats that shift faster than abiotic environmental conditions may instead decrease specialist persistence in its current range and favour environmental, but not geographical range stability. It is clear that non-equilibrium dynamics in species distributions are key elements of complexity. Hence, predictions are likely to be biased without proper models to account for it.</p>
         <p>Correlative SDMs predict direct response of species’ range to habitat amount variations such that a decrease in habitat amount causes an equivalent contraction of the species’ range. However, we have shown that a metapopulation framework offers complementary information to extract from habitat projections. The contraction of a species’ range may be accelerated (or slowed) by metapopulation dynamics. Here, the effect of landscape connectivity interacts with habitat occupancy to generate dynamics of greater complexity. We observed changes in the Bicknell’s Thrush distribution projections in both habitat amount and in spatial structure of habitat patches. Landscape connectivity was affected by newly suitable habitat patches, the extinction of the smallest habitat patches, the fragmentation of the larger ones, and the dispersal distance. In concordance with our intuition, changes in Bicknell’s Thrush persistence were affected by metapopulation dynamics. Persistence could not be explained by changes in habitat amount alone contrasting with the assumption made by correlative SDMs (Figure <a href="#fig:persistence">6</a>). Furthermore, our results support <span class="citation" data-cites="hanski_habitat_2015">Hanski (<a href="#ref-hanski_habitat_2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> in that connectivity is fundamental to species regional distribution, abundance, and biodiversity in opposition to the habitat amount hypothesis <span class="citation" data-cites="fahrig_rethinking_2013">(Fahrig <a href="#ref-fahrig_rethinking_2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>. That is because the species’ ability to use all available habitat is affected by dispersal, which habitat amount alone does not represent.</p>
         <p>More favourable abiotic environmental conditions can have unexpected negative impacts on specialists if their habitats are negatively affected. We described this phenomenon as the effect of environmental response correlation between trophic levels (see <em>Key concepts</em> section). It is a concept unique to process-based approaches that cannot be observed directly using a correlative SDM approach as it originates from the joint effects of species-specific environmental performance and of biotic interactions. Although we have not been able to measure it directly with the Bicknell’s Thrush case, we observed an important contrast between its response to climate-only change and to climate-induced forest change: the habitat amount increased in the first scenario and declined in the second. We showed that regionally more favourable climatic conditions to the Bicknell’s Thrush may have, even if only temporarily due to colonization or extinction lags, the opposite effect on its habitat. Therefore, the resulting distribution dynamics from the interplay between trophic levels are complex to predict. Counterintuitive dynamics can arise from species’ environmental correlation. Indeed, the Bicknell’s thrush example illustrates the necessity of documenting the response between trophic levels to a rapidly changing environment as they can produce non-equilibrium dynamics when considered together. It is when the lower trophic level affects the specialist’s colonization and extinction rates asymmetrically that non-equilibrium distribution dynamics are observed. Because metapopulation models can incorporate such dynamics on specialists’ population dynamics, the resulting projections may be of greater realism.</p>
         <h2 id="limitations-of-the-current-approach">Limitations of the current approach</h2>
         <p>Metapopulation models require few parameters making them relatively easy to parameterize. Even in the absence of a calibrated model, the metapopulation approach offers tools to interpret projections outputs from correlative SDMs. We showed that different aspects of the landscape’s structure could easily be described and studied. An integrated interpretation of distribution changes can be gained from scenarios of dispersal and extinction. Such scenarios can then be used to evaluate species persistence.</p>
         <p>Several other factors could also impact the system’s response to climate warming. The model described here is best suited for habitat specialists whose presence depends on the prior establishment of another species that they do not impact, but it could also be generalized to other types of interactions <span class="citation" data-cites="gravel_trophic_2011">(Gravel et al. <a href="#ref-gravel_trophic_2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>. The concepts developed in this study are more general than the specialist-habitat context in which they are presented and can apply to any bottom-up system. Positive and negative effects of the specialist on its habitat could influence the system’s response to climate change differently. For example, habitat (i.e., resource) removal by the specialist may reduce competition of habitat types and decrease response lag, accelerating the specialist’s decline at the scale of the landscape <span class="citation" data-cites="vissault_slow_2020">(Vissault et al. <a href="#ref-vissault_slow_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>. Prolonged occupancy of the habitat by the specialist may, on the other hand, increase habitat mismatch and support source-sink dynamics <span class="citation" data-cites="pulliam_sources_1988">(Pulliam <a href="#ref-pulliam_sources_1988" role="doc-biblioref">1988</a>)</span>. In addition to biotic interactions, metapopulation dynamics at the landscape level could be affected by the interaction of climate change and natural disturbances. For instance, wildfires and insect outbreak regimes are expected to be strongly altered under climate change <span class="citation" data-cites="boulanger_boreal_2021">(Boulanger and Pascual Puigdevall <a href="#ref-boulanger_boreal_2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>, and associated biodiversity (see <span class="citation" data-cites="tremblay_harvesting_2018">Tremblay et al. (<a href="#ref-tremblay_harvesting_2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> for a case study). Both are important drivers of forest dynamics, and our results show that modification in habitat distribution is associated with the specialist response.</p>
         <p>We hope that biodiversity actors benefit from more accurate, yet accessible methods to estimate distribution changes. Correlative SDMs are most often used to project distribution changes, but metapopulation models allow a more accurate estimation of colonization and extinction rates with a multispecies perspective. Our estimation of the Bicknell’s Thrush range projected that the biotic interactions will favour the species’ persistence where it already occurs, but will limit its progression further north where firs are not as abundant despite increases in climate suitability. The resulting effect is likely to be the regional contraction of the Bicknell’s Thrush range despite more favourable climatic conditions. Our study highlights the importance of demography, dispersal and biotic interactions on distribution change to rapid environmental change and the importance of spatial structure on the interpretation of projections.</p>
