*Examination of the predictions of a simple two species metapopulation model can present dynamics that differ from widespread correlative approaches.*
We show the complex distribution dynamics of a species based on a simple metapopulation resourceâ€“consumer system.

*Consider a region where each local patch can be colonized by a resource and its consumer, given that the resource establishes first.*
Ignoring dispersal limitations, a consumer ($P$) can colonize a local site if the habitat composed of environmental conditions ($E$) and resource ($R$) presence are adequate. 
The consumer prevalence dynamics are described by metapopulation differential equasions:

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = c_{R}(E)R(1-R) - e_{R}(E)R
$$

$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = c_{P}(E)P(R(E)-P) - e_{P}(E)P
$$

Where $c$ is the colonization rate, $e$ is the extinction rate. Both $c$ and $e$ are species-specific demographic functions of the abiotic environment. 

The conditions for consumer equilibrium in the landscape are described by the balance of resource availability and species characteristics:

$$
P^{*} = R^{*} - \frac{e_{P}}{c_{P}}
$$

and its distribution limit is defined by $P^{*} = 0$, such that it is located where resource availability is balanced by the ratio of consumer extinction and colonization.


*Resource mismatch effect on consumer distribution shift.*
Fig 1A.
The range limit of a consumer is determined by the equilibrium of habitat availability and species-specific demographic rates.
At equilibrium, the distribution limit remains static on environmental gradient and its distribution shift follows that of the environmental conditions.
Desequilibrium (extinction debt/colonisation credit) can arise from slow demography or limited dispersal resulting in a mismatch.
Resource mismatch is the modification of resource availability to consumer.
Change in resource availability affects the position of the environmental distribution limit and affects the consumer distribution shift, resulting in the consumer present at environmental conditions where he was previously absent or absent where he was previously present.

*Non-linear response of occupancy with climate change in metapopulations versus the linear response of a standard SDM*

Linear (constant) shift of environmental conditions on homogenous landscape.
SDMs assume distribution to be at equilibrium with abiotic environmental conditions and to respond instantaneously, therefore predicticting linerar changes in consumer prevalence.

In contrast, the metapopulation approach takes a mechanistic approach, where the equilirbium prevalence of the consumer is defined by the combined effects of environmental conditions on species-specific demographic functions and on resource availability, hence projecting non-linear prevalence changes.

If the spatial disposition of patches is added, the effect of reduction in habitat patch size, habitat patch extinction, and increase in inter-patch distance from abiotic conditions shifts further reduces the consumer's hability to reach all suitable locations (Hanski 2000). This loss of connectivity may not have an important effect at firts while suitable habitat patches are abundant, but may increase as habitat availability decreases, supporting non-linear response of metapopulations to a constant abiotic environmental shift (Hanski 2000, Ovaskainen 2002).

*The effect of environmental change on lower trophic levels can propagate up and affect higher trophic levels.*

Environmental correlation between trophic levels.
The effect of more favorable abiotic conditions to a top level species could be detrimental if the environment becomes less favorable for the lower trophic level.


*In regard to these assumptions, a metapopulation approach present projections of greater complexity and better realism*
