*Examination of the predictions of a simple two species metapopulation model presents dynamics that differ from widespread correlative approaches.*
Examination of the predictions of a simple two species metapopulation model presents dynamics that differ from widespread correlative approaches.
To demontrate the complexity arising in metapopulation distribution dynamics, consider a simple resourceâ€“consumer system in which each local patch can be colonized by a resource ($R$) and its consumer ($P$), given that the resource establishes first and the abiotic environmental conditions ($E$) are adequate;

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = c_{R}(E)R(1-R) - e_{R}(E)R
$$

$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = c_{P}(E)P(R(E)-P) - e_{P}(E)P
$$

Where $c$ is the colonization rate and $e$ the extinction rate. Both are species-specific demographic functions of the abiotic environment. 
A consumer persists in a balance between resource availability, colonization, and extinctions:

$$
P^{*} = R^{*} - \frac{e_{P}}{c_{P}}
$$

and its distribution limit is defined by $P^{*} = 0$, such that it is located where $R = \frac{e}{c}$. Thus, when resource availability is balanced by the ratio of extinction and colonization.


*Resource mismatch effect on consumer distribution shift.*
This implies that low trophic level mismatch affects top level distribution shift in abiotic environemntal conditions change scenario (Fig 1A).
The top trophic level distribution represents environmental conditions where resource availability (R, green line) is supperior to its extinction to colonization ratio (e/c, orange line).
At equilibrium, the abiotic conditions contained within a species distribution remain stable despite environmental change; the distribution shifts instanteneously (Fig 1A., shaded area).
If we observe an environemntal mismatch of the resource (Fig 1A., arrow) such that $R > R^{*}$ (Fig 1A., green dashed line), the consumer could reach a greater equilibrium prevalence. Conversely, if $R < R^{*}$, the equilibrium prevalence is less.
Therefore, low trophic level response to abiotic conditions change influence  the top species distribution extent and distribution limits.
Thus, the position of the top trophic level distribution limit shifts from its theoretical equilibrium position toward that of the lower level, modifying its response to new environemental conditions and distribution shift.


*Non-linear response of occupancy with climate change in metapopulations contrasts with the linear response of a standard SDM.*
The consumer's equilibrium prevalence equasion shows that a linear change in environmental conditions causes non-linear response of occupancy with climate change in metapopulations which contrasts with the linear response of a standard SDM (Fig 1B).
SDMs assume distributions to remain within equilibrium abiotic environmental conditions and to respond instantaneously, therefore predicticting linerar changes in consumer prevalence (full line).
In contrast, distribution change of the top trophic level from the metapopulation approach are projected from the combined effects of environmental conditions on demographic performance and resource distribution. 
Imagine a landscape composed of a set of habitat patches with a gradient in abiotic environmental conditions. The contraction of the landscape's favorable environmental conditions here has two effects: first a reduction in resource availability from what follows a loss of suitable habitat area, increasing extinction rates.
Both resource availability and habitat patch area being correlated, the effect of environmental change on prevalence is amplified.
The amplification effect may not be important at first while suitable habitat is abundant, but increases as habitat availability decreases, supporting accelerated response of metapopulation persistence to a constant abiotic environmental shift (Hanski 2000, Ovaskainen 2002).

*The effect of environmental change on lower trophic levels can propagate up and affect higher trophic levels.*
The effect of more favorable abiotic conditions to a top level species could be detrimental if the environment becomes less favorable for the lower trophic levels (Fig. 1C).
Here, top trophic level occupancy increases (green) as conditions change beneficiates both top and lower levels (2nd quadrant) or as one level beneficiates more than the other suffers (1st and 4rth quadrants).
Reversely, a decrease in top level species prevalence (red) is caused by less favorable conditions to the top level species (quadrant 1), to the bottom level species (quadrant 4) or to both (quadrant 3).
Perfect matching of both levels' environmental performance is represented by the dased line.  
Thus, the environmental correlation between trophic levels - the relative position of environmental optimum and envrionmental breadth - may affect top level species response in non-intuitive ways.


*In regard to these intuitions, a metapopulation approach presents projections of greater complexity and increased realism*

Panel A shows that the position of the top trophic level distribution limit is affected by the bottom level prevalence. 
Panel B presents the response of a consumer to a linear environmental change in time as projected by a metapopulation model (stripped line) and a standard SDM (full line). 
Panel C shows that the response of a bottom trophic species to an environmental change affects the response of higher levels.
