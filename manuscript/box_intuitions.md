*Examination of the predictions of a simple two species metapopulation model presents dynamics that differ from widespread correlative approaches.*
Examination of the predictions of a simple two species metapopulation model presents dynamics that differ from widespread correlative approaches.
To demontrate the complexity arising in metapopulation distribution dynamics, consider a simple resourceâ€“consumer system in which each local patch can be colonized by a resource ($R$) and its consumer ($P$), given that the resource establishes first and the abiotic environmental conditions ($E$) are adequate;

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = c_{R}(E)R(1-R) - e_{R}(E)R
$$

$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = c_{P}(E)P(R(E)-P) - e_{P}(E)P
$$

Where $c$ is the colonization rate and $e$ the extinction rate. Both are species-specific demographic functions of the abiotic environment. 
A consumer persists in equilibrium in a balance between resource availability, colonization, and extinctions:

$$
P^{*} = R^{*} - \frac{e_{P}}{c_{P}}
$$

and its distribution limit is defined by $P^{*} = 0$, such that it is located where $R = \frac{e}{c}$. Thus, it occurs where resource availability is balanced by the ratio of extinction and colonization.


*Resource mismatch effect on consumer distribution shift.*
This implies that environmental mismatch of the lower trophic level affects top-level distribution shift in abiotic environmental conditions change scenario (Fig 1A).
The top trophic level distribution represents environmental conditions where resource availability (R, green line) is superior to its extinction to colonization ratio (e/c, orange line).
At equilibrium, the abiotic conditions contained within a species distribution remain stable despite environmental change; the distribution shifts instantaneously (Fig 1A., shaded area).
If we observe an environmental mismatch of the resource (Fig 1A., arrow) such that $R > R^{*}$ (Fig 1A., green dashed line), the consumer could reach a greater equilibrium prevalence. Conversely, if $R < R^{*}$, the equilibrium prevalence is less.
Therefore, low trophic level response to abiotic conditions change influences the top species distribution extent and the position of itd distribution limits.
Thus, the position of the top trophic level distribution limit can shift from its theoretical equilibrium position toward that of the lower-level species if this last lags, modifying its response to new environmental conditions.


*Non-linear response of occupancy with climate change in metapopulations contrasts with the linear response of a standard SDM.*
The consumer's equilibrium prevalence equation shows that non-linear response of prevalence can arise in metapopulations from a linear change in environmental conditions (Fig 1B).
This prediction contrasts with the linear response of a standard SDM.
SDMs assume distributions to remain within equilibrium abiotic environmental conditions and to respond instantaneously, therefore projecting linear changes in consumer prevalence (Fig 1B; full line).
In contrast, distribution changes from the metapopulation approach are projected from the combined effects of new environmental conditions on demographic performance and resource distribution. 
Imagine a landscape composed of a set of habitat patches with a gradient in abiotic environmental conditions. The linear contraction of the landscape's favourable environmental conditions here has two effects: first a reduction in resource availability $R$ from what follows a loss of suitable habitat area, increasing extinction rates $e$ (Hanski 2000).
Resource availability and habitat patch area being correlated, the effect of environmental change on prevalence is amplified (Hanski 2000).
The amplification effect may not be important at first while suitable habitat is abundant, but increases as habitat availability decreases, supporting an acceleration of metapopulation prevalence loss to a constant abiotic environmental shift (Hanski 2000, Ovaskainen 2002).

*The effect of environmental change on lower trophic levels can propagate up and affect higher trophic levels.*
The effect of more favourable abiotic conditions to a top-level species could be detrimental if the environment becomes less favourable for the lower trophic levels (Fig. 1C).
Here, top trophic level occupancy increases (green) as conditions change benefits both top and lower levels (2nd quadrant) or as one level benefit more than the other suffers (1st and 4rth quadrants).
Conversely, a decrease in top-level species prevalence (red) is caused by less favourable conditions to the top-level species (quadrant 1), to the bottom level species (quadrant 4) or to both (quadrant 3).
Perfect matching of both levels' environmental performance is represented by the dashed line.  
Thus, the environmental correlation between trophic levels - the relative position of environmental optimum and environmental breadth - may affect top-level species response in non-intuitive ways.


*In regard to these intuitions, a metapopulation approach presents projections of greater complexity and increased realism*

Panel A shows that the position of the top trophic level distribution limit is affected by the bottom level prevalence. 
Panel B presents the response of a top trophic level species to a linear environmental change in time as projected by a metapopulation model (stripped line) and a standard SDM (full line). 
Panel C shows that the response of a bottom trophic species to an environmental change affects the response of higher levels.
