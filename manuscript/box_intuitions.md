*Examination of the predictions of a simple two species metapopulation model can present dynamics that differ from widespread correlative approaches.*
We show the complex distribution dynamics of a species based on a simple metapopulation resourceâ€“consumer system.

*Consider a region where each local patch can be colonized by a resource and its consumer, given that the resource establishes first.*
Ignoring dispersal limitations, a consumer ($P$) can colonize a local site if the habitat composed of environmental conditions ($E$) and resource ($R$) presence are adequate. 
The consumer prevalence dynamics are described by metapopulation differential equasions:

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = c_{R}(E)R(1-R) - e_{R}(E)R
$$

$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = c_{P}(E)P(R(E)-P) - e_{P}(E)P
$$

Where $c$ is the colonization rate, $e$ is the extinction rate. Both $c$ and $e$ are species-specific demographic functions of the abiotic environment. 

The conditions for consumer equilibrium in the landscape are described by the balance of resource availability and species characteristics:

$$
P^{*} = R^{*} - \frac{e_{P}}{c_{P}}
$$

and its distribution limit is defined by $P^{*} = 0$, such that it is located where resource availability is balanced by the ratio of consumer extinction and colonization.


*Resource mismatch effect on consumer distribution shift.*
Fig 1A.
The range limit of a consumer is determined by the equilibrium of habitat availability and species-specific demographic rates.
At equilibrium, the species distribution limits remain static on the environmental gradient and its distribution shift with environmental conditions.
Desequilibrium (extinction debt/colonisation credit) can arise from slow demography or limited dispersal resulting in a mismatch.
Resource mismatch results in the modification of resource availability to the consumer.
Change in resource availability affects the position and the extent of the consumer's distribution at equilibrium, thus affecting its response to new conditions and distribution shift.
In response, the abiotic conditions contained within the consumer distribution may change: the distribution may extend to novel conditions or contract. 

*Non-linear response of occupancy (prevalence) with climate change in metapopulations contrasts with the linear response of a standard SDM*
Fig 1B.
Linear (constant) shift of environmental conditions on homogenous landscape.
SDMs assume distribution to remain within equilibrium abiotic environmental conditions and to respond instantaneously, therefore predicticting linerar changes in consumer prevalence.
In contrast, the metapopulation approach takes a mechanistic approach, where the modification of abiotic environmental conditions affects consumer distribution through combined effects on demographic performance and resource distribution, hence projecting non-linear prevalence changes.
If the spatial disposition of patches is added, the effect of reduction in habitat patch size, habitat patch extinction, and increase in inter-patch distance from abiotic conditions shifts further reduces the consumer's hability to reach all suitable locations (Hanski 2000). This loss of connectivity may not have an important effect at first while suitable habitat patches are abundant, but may increase as habitat availability decreases, supporting non-linear response of metapopulations to a constant abiotic environmental shift (Hanski 2000, Ovaskainen 2002).

*The effect of environmental change on lower trophic levels can propagate up and affect higher trophic levels.*
Fig 1C.
Environmental correlation between trophic levels corresponds to the concordance of performance between top and lower trophic levels for given environmental conditions.
The effect of more favorable abiotic conditions to a top level species could be detrimental if the environment becomes less favorable for the lower trophic level.
The consumer response to abiotic condition changes can be affected by the environmental correlation to its resource. 
The correlation can change if the resource response is limited and thus complexify the distribution dynamics of the consumer.


*In regard to these intuitions, a metapopulation approach present projections of greater complexity and increased realism*
