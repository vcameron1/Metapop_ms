title: Various effects of climate change on landscape suitability

Consider metapopulations as a population of populations connected by dispersal and the distribution of a species as the ensemble of occupied habitat patches.
The suitability of a heterogeneous landscape can therefore be defined as its ability to support persistence of a species which is determined by local patch abiotic and biotic environmental factors, but also by the species’ ability to occupy suitable patches.
Thus, species persistence, and landscape suitability, are functions of local environmental conditions and landscape connectivity.

In this regard, climate change can profoundly alter the landscape as experienced by species.
When looking at local patches, climate change alters the distribution of environmental conditions and causes elevational shifts and general warming of climatic conditions.
The consequence for fragmented landscapes is patch size contraction or extinction of the smaller ones (Fig. 1).
Larger patches can also become fragmented into smaller ones (Fig. 1).

Not only smaller patches are assumed to support smaller population sizes, have superior extinction risks and produce fewer colonizers (Hanski 2000), but the loss and the fragmentation of patches alter species dispersal ability through the loss of connecting links between populations.
These processes support reduction in population size and their isolation. 

The overall effect of climate changes is not only to modify local patches, but to change species ability to colonize and occupy these patches. 
Consequently, at the metapopulation level, a linear climate change can precipitate species prevalence decline.
