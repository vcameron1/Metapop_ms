Considering metapopulations as a population of populations on a landscape and the distribution of a species as the area of suitable climate and habitat,climate change has interesting effects defined by the properties of the metapopulation.

Persistence of a species (suitability of the landscape) is function of the connectivity which is the species ability to occupy suitable patches. 
Suitability of patches is defined by the biotic and abiotic environmental suitability of the landscape.
Dispersal connects patches of varying sizes that constitute species distribution on heterogeneous landscapes.
We generally assume that greater patch size allows greater population size which has implications for extinction risk and colonization probability.

Climate change changes landscape suitability in multiple ways.
The primary effect of climate change that is captured by basic SDMs is modification of abiotic conditions.
On heterogeneous landscapes that present environmental gradients, climate change will affect the distribution of these environmental conditions and in the case of climate warming it will cause the contraction of the cold-liking species suitable area.
The first effect is therefore patch contraction.
Similarly, certain of the smaller patches might become completely unsuitable, having a profound effect on the landscape and have the population go extinct.

The overall effect of environmental changes is not only to reduce patch area, but to change species dispersal ability and general connectivity of the landscape through reduction of patch size and isolation processes.
