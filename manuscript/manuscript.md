title: Metapopulation approach for distribution projection in rapid environmental changes

## Introduction

*Expected environmental changes have motivated important advancements in distribution modeling.* 
Current models mostly assume single species with restrictive assumptions for dispersal processes
More mechanistic approaches are however required to project future species distribution and several calls have been made for process-based models (Urban 2016). → C’est beau le dire, mais ce n’est pas facile à faire

*Review of some of the methods such as dynamic range models and forest gap models.*
Process-based models are hard to do
What they are : based on niche theory, positive growth rate 
These are however data hungry and often hard to parameterize
In other situations, we find that local dynamics are insufficient to explain large scale species distribution (e.g. article d’Amael)
Conclusion from those is that processes at larger scales must be considered (e.g. dispersal limitations, disturbances etc…)

*Another approach recently proposed is derived from metapopulation theory.*

*Metapopulation can easily be expanded to include more complexity, such as landscape heterogeneity and biotic interactions.*
Spatially explicit incidence functions
Competition and pre-emption in Vissault
Trophic interactions
 
*Objective of the paper. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the value of metapopulation model projections of distribution changes to support decision making and policy in rapidly changing environments.*
une approche de métapopulation permet de le faire, en se basant sur la théorie, en ajoutant des contraintes démographiques, de dispersion et les interactions biotiques. Le tout en utilisant des données empiriques.

*The model was inspired to simulate the Bicknell's thrush, a bird characteristic of species of interest to decision makers and policy (COSEWIC).*

Requirement of a particular type of habitat

## Methods

### Model structure 
*We illustrate the applicability of the approach by expanding a metapopulation model to two species.*
Description verbable de la dynamique
Schémas ? (Box 2)
Description / inteprétation des probabilités de transition
	
### Parameterization 
*To simulate landscape-wide forest dynamics, we used a state and transition model (Vissault 2020).*
Dispersal kernels (vegetation, bird)
Vegetation transitions
Landscape structure

### Scenarios & analysis
*To project Bicknell's thrush distribution changes, we simulated forest successional dynamics and metapopulation dynamics under climate warming scenarios.*
Climate dependence of colonization and extinction

*We assessed distribution changes with measures of cumulative changes and their temporal trends.*

## Results


## Discussion

*Paragraphe 1. Our objective was to develop a tool relevant to decision making and policy that can manage the complexity arising from biotic interactions and dispersal.*
Our study reveals that the extent of the response to climate warming is likely to be impacted by bottom-up interactions and landscape structure.
We derived three observations from metapopulation theory
	1. We found that a *mismatch* of the consumer and its favorable climate emerges as a property of the metapopulation approach. Using a metapopulation approach, we showed that climate warming could lead to a decrease in the environmental *correlation between trophic levels*.
	2. precipitation of the decline with habitat shrinking and connectivity
	3. importance of the correlation in the environmental response between trophic levels
inspired by a real case scenario, we have shown how theory could be relevant to decision making and policy.
In this study, we did not consider a parametrized model for the Bicknell's thrush.

*Paragraph 2. habitat-abiotic mismatch*

*Paragraph 3. Metapopulation approach. Importance of connectivity. Mountain tops.*

*Paragraph 4. Importance of environmental correlation between trophic levels. We don’t really know that.*

*Paragraph 5. Although metapopulation models are easy to parameterize, they require species-specific colonization, extinction, and dispersal information.*

*Paragraph 6. Several other factors could also impact the system's reponse to climate warming.* Metapopulation models are very general and easy to expand. 
Can be generalized to other interactions (see e.g. Gravel and Massol for a very general model). 
More complex landscape structures. 

*Paragraph 7. Retour sur la grive.* 
We have shown that metapopulation models are tools of value for conservation practitionners.

	3. The effect of environmental change on lower trophic levels can propagate up and affect higher trophic levels.  the effect of more favorable abiotic conditions to a top level species could be detrimental if the environment becomes less favorable for the lower trophic level. Figure : change in prevalence of a top species (color) as a function of the optimal temperature of the lower trophic level (x axis) and the higher trophic level (y axis).
