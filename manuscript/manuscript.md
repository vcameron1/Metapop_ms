## Introduction

Expected environmental changes have motivated important advancements in distribution modeling.

Current models mostly assume single species in uniform landscapes.

Metapopulation models can mechanistically project distribution changes that emerge from relevant abiotic and biotic processes.

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the value of metapopulation model projections of distribution changes to support decision making and policy in rapidly changing environments.


## Methods

We illustrate the applicability of the approach by expanding a metapopulation model to two species.

The model was parameterized to simulate the Bicknell's thrush, a bird caracteristic of species of interest to decision makers and policy (COSEWIC).

To simulate landscape-wide forest dynamics, we used a state and transition model (Vissault 2020).

To project Bicknell's thrush distribution changes, we simulated forest successional dynamics and metapopulation dynamics under climate warming scenarios.

We assessed distribution changes with measures of cumulative changes and their temporal trends.


## Results


## Discussion

Our objective was to develop a tool relevant to decision making and policy that can manage the complexity arising from biotic interactions and dispersal.

Our study reveals that the extent of the response to climate warming is likely to be impacted by bottom-up interactions and landscape structure.

We found that a *mismatch* of the consumer and its favorable climate emerges as a property of the metapopulation approach.
    Consequence of the transiant response of the system to climate warming.

Using a metapopulation approach, we showed that climate warming could lead to a decrease in the environmental *correlation between trophic levels*.

Using a theoretical example, we showed the relevance of metapopulation simulations for decision making and policy.

In this study, we did not consider a parametrized model for the Bicknell's thrush. 
    The parametized habitat model we used and several studies before us show that a lot of data is already available, and the implementation is accessible. 

Although metapopulation models are easy to parameterize, they require species-specific colonization, extinction, and dispersal information.

Several other factors could also impact the system's reponse to climate warming. 
    Interaction strength

We have shown that metapopulation models are tools of value for conservation practitionners.
