## Introduction

*Expected environmental changes have motivated important advancements in distribution modeling.* 
Climate change has already prompted species to shift their range toward higher latitudes and elevations (Parmesan 2006, Chen et al. 2011).
To protect ecosystems, we need to predict how communities will be affected to coordonate efficient conservation actions.
Commonly used models are most often statistical and based on the relationship between abiotic conditions and current species distribution.
They present several limitations to their ability to model distribution dynamics while they mostly assume single species with restrictive assumptions for dispersal processes.
More flexible, but similar models have been proposed to study the role of spatial and biotic sources of compelxity in shaping species distributions (j-SDMs; Pollock et al. 2014, Warton 2015).
However, they lack grounding in theoretical ecology and present difficulties when extrapolated to new environmental conditions.
Our current lack of knowledge and tools for the prediction pf species distribution responses to environmental changes poses serious limitations on the efficiency of future conservation actions.
While most current predictive approaches ingnore important biological mechanisms, these mechanisms are known to play an important role in species distribution response to environmental change (Urban 2016).
More mechanistic approaches are required to project species distribution and several calls have been made for process-based models (Fordham 2013, Urban 2016).
While correlative SDMs are widely used in conservation planning (Guisan 2013), few process-based models are currently used in management of species under climate change.


Current models mostly assume single species with restrictive assumptions for dispersal processes.
More mechanistic approaches are however required to project future species distribution and several calls have been made for process-based models (Urban 2016). → C’est beau le dire, mais ce n’est pas facile à faire

*Review of some of the methods such as dynamic range models and forest gap models.*
In regards to recent efforts, explicit modelling of the processes that underly distribution dynamics is challenging to implement (Hefley, 2017, Briscoe 2021).
Process-based models such as dynamic range models and forest gap models relate species abundances to abiotic environmental conditions using population growth rate and dispersal.
They have the advantage of being strongly rooted in ecological theory and take from niche theory in that environmental performance is driven by demographic rates, linking species distributions to population performance (Svenning 2014, Godsoe 2017).
However, these are often difficult to parameterize, data demanding both in quantity and quality, and computationally intensive (Snell 2014). 
Measuring growth rate is challenging (McGill 2012), and require very specific data on species response to abiotic conditions.
Indeed, the data required for these models are rarely available (Urban 2016).
Futhermore, we find in other situations that local dynamics are insufficient to explain large scale species distribution (Le Squin 2021).
This suggests that processes at larger scales must be considered. 
Such processes should include dispersal limitations, disturbances, biotic interactions, etc… (Urban 2016????, Stephan 2021).


Process-based models are hard to do
What they are : based on niche theory, positive growth rate 
These are however data hungry and often hard to parameterize
In other situations, we find that local dynamics are insufficient to explain large scale species distribution (e.g. article d’Amael)
Conclusion from those is that processes at larger scales must be considered (e.g. dispersal limitations, disturbances etc…)

*Another approach recently proposed is derived from metapopulation theory.*
Another approach recently proposed is derived from metapopulation theory.
Like range dynamic models, metapopulation models relate demography to the geographical distribution of the niche (Holt 2009).
In contrast to range dynamic models, metapopulation models rest on the assumption that distributions result from the interaction of habitat availability, local extinction, and colonization dynamics (Holt 2000).
Theoretical studies showed that a gradient in any of these three fundamental metapopulation precesses can lead to the establishment and shape distribution limits (Holt 2000).
These processes are not only fundamental to the difinition of species distribution in a metapopulation context, but also to its dynamics. 
Study of dispersal evolution using metapopulation models have put forward the importance of dispersal in defining species distribution and response to changes in environmental condition (Holt 2003).
For example, Fordham et al. (2013) used the metapopulation approach and environmental and prey availability projections to investigate the Iberian lynx distribution change according to different climate change and management scenarios. 
Within metapopulation models, changes in environmental conditions act on specie's demography and dispersal utimately modulating species response (Svenning 2014), allowing the study of non-equilirbium dynamics of species distributions.
The approach was used to investigate extinction debts and colonization credits in tree species current distribution (Talluto 2017) where limitations in dispersal and slow demography were found to cause mismatch between current tree species distribution and favorable climatic conditions.

These studies put forward the importance of dispersal, landscape connectivity, and local population dynamics as drivers of large scale distributions.

Variation in the local population dynamics of a metapopulation model is a driver of distibution dynamics at larger scales. Environmental changes can affect the distribution dynamics and distribution limits shift (Holt 2003).

The metapopulation approach allowed to test the importance of different mechanisms and their interaction on distribution response

Non-equilibrium metapopulation dynamics.
Metapopulation models allow to study distribution dynamics and is not limited by novel environmental conditions (Talluto 2017).

*Metapopulation can easily be expanded to include more complexity, such as landscape heterogeneity and biotic interactions.*
An approach based on metapopulation theory can easily be expanded to include more complexity, such as landscape heterogeneity and biotic interactions.
The framework is flexible as the effect of dispersal and mechanisms acting on demography can simultaneously be taken into account in spatially explicit models.
These spatially explicit models capture landscape heterogeneity effect on distribution dynamics through modulation of the propagule pressure and ultimately the colonization of empty habitat patches.
Habitat patch specific traits can be taken into account. For example, spatially explicit indicence functions take into acount habitat patch size and distance from other patches to influence extinction and colonization processes, and distribution dynamics (Hanski 1999).
The effect of biotic inteactions on species' distributions and reponses to environmental changes remains a challenge to understand for ecologists and to represent for modelers (Guilman 2010, Wisz 2013, Godsoe 2017).
Environmental change can affect species in a community differently because each has its own environmental optimum and breadth, but also its own hability to respond (Box 1).
By taking into account the effects of biotic interactions on the rate and extent of distribution expansion, metapopulation models present an elegant way of including the effects of biotic interactions on species distributions that remains rooted into theory (Svenning 2014, Talluto 2017).
Both positive and negative biotic interactions on distribution dynamics with the potential of expanding or limiting distribution shifts can be included into metapopulation models (Box 1). 
An example of such application was shown by Vissault et al. (2020) who studied the dynamics of Northeastern-American forests in response to climate warming and observed that competition plays an important role in forests response.
In their simulations, long lived boreal species prevented the establishment of temperate species despite being in unfavorable climatic conditions.
Trophic interactions have also been explored in metapopulation models. 
Fordham et al. (2013) studied a two species system in context of environmental change where prey availability modulated the predator's habitat availability and extinction.
They show that prey availability was a key factor to predator persistence, demontrating that trophic interactions are important to consider in the context of climate change.

*Objective of the paper. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the value of metapopulation model projections of distribution changes to support decision making and policy in rapidly changing environments.*
The metapopulation approach is a powerful and flexible tool to simulate distribution changes.
Resulting models can include demographical and dispersal constraints, and biotic interactions which previous approaches have not managed to do explicitely while remaining accessible.
The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the value of the metapopulation approach to project distribution changes in support to decision making and policy in rapidly changing environments.
Metapopulation models have the advantage of being parameterizable while being less data demanding than previous models (Vissault 2020) and remaining simple and rooted in ecological theory (Holt 2009).
Futhermore, the data needed to parameterize them is accessible now that time series of species occurence are available for a broad range of species (Hanski ????, Fordham 2013, Talluto 2017, Vissault 2020).

une approche de métapopulation permet de le faire, en se basant sur la théorie, en ajoutant des contraintes démographiques, de dispersion et les interactions biotiques. Le tout en utilisant des données empiriques.

We assess distribution change using abundances and transiant dynamics (Boulangeat 2018).
We demonstrate the ability of a coupled metapopulation model to project the Bicknell's thrush distribution in Northestern America and the forest response to different climate changes scenarios.
The Bicknell's thrush breeding range is defined by cool climates, elevation and habitat type (Cadieux 2019). 
This habitat specialist is found in a fragmented landscape composed of mountain tops dominated by stands of boreal forest, and connected through dispersal (COSEWIC 2009).

## Results


## Discussion

*Paragraphe 1. Our objective was to develop a tool relevant to decision making and policy that can manage the complexity arising from biotic interactions and dispersal.*
Our study reveals that the extent of the response to climate warming is likely to be impacted by bottom-up interactions and landscape structure.
We derived three observations from metapopulation theory
	1. We found that a *mismatch* of the consumer and its favorable climate emerges as a property of the metapopulation approach. Using a metapopulation approach, we showed that climate warming could lead to a decrease in the environmental *correlation between trophic levels*.
	2. precipitation of the decline with habitat shrinking and connectivity
	3. importance of the correlation in the environmental response between trophic levels
inspired by a real case scenario, we have shown how theory could be relevant to decision making and policy.
In this study, we did not consider a parametrized model for the Bicknell's thrush.

*Paragraph 2. habitat-abiotic mismatch*

*Paragraph 3. Metapopulation approach. Importance of connectivity. Mountain tops.*

*Paragraph 4. Importance of environmental correlation between trophic levels. We don’t really know that.*

*Paragraph 5. Although metapopulation models are easy to parameterize, they require species-specific colonization, extinction, and dispersal information.*

*Paragraph 6. Several other factors could also impact the system's reponse to climate warming.* Metapopulation models are very general and easy to expand. 
Can be generalized to other interactions (see e.g. Gravel and Massol for a very general model). 
More complex landscape structures. 

*Paragraph 7. Retour sur la grive.* 
We have shown that metapopulation models are tools of value for conservation practitionners.
