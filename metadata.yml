title: "Spatial Structure is More Than Habitat Amount: A Metapopulation Approach is Necessary to Project Distributions Under Climate Change"
running_title: ""
abstract: "Projecting species distributions under climate change requires going beyond climate suitability models. We propose that metapopulation theory can be used to leverage species distribution models while accounting for landscape spatial structure, biotic interactions and demography. While reviewing how metapopulation theory reacts to climate-induced distribution shifts, we found that habitat-climate mismatch can generate non-equilibrium dynamics, linear change in habitat occupancy generates non-linear distribution change, and the effect of environmental change on habitat can have counterintuitive effects on higher trophic levels. We illustrated our findings by developing habitat suitability models for the Bicknell's Thrush (*Catharus bicknelli*) a red-listed bird species confined to perturbed balsam fir forests. Under climate warming, the Bicknell's Thrush distribution shifts northwards from the effect of climate alone while the distribution of its associated vegetation remains stable despite warming. The arising mismatch between climate and vegetation changes patch size, connectivity, and habitat structure potentially to different extent, influencing species persistence and suggesting that habitat alone is not enough to characterize regional distribution changes. Our results emphasize the importance of both habitat and landscape spatial structure in assessing persistence for which metapopulation theory is an ideal framework to further advance our understanding of species distribution."
