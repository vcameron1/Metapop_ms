title: "Distributions are more than habitat amount: the metapopulation structure is a vital element to distribution change"
running_title: "Projecting distribution using metapopulation approach"
abstract: "Distribution modelling has traditionally used bioclimatic models, which are limited in their ability to model distribution dynamics and mostly assume single species with limited consideration of dispersal processes. We build upon recent mechanistic approaches, demonstrating that metapopulation theory can manage the complexity arising from processes such as biotic interactions, demography, and landscape structure. We developed a theoretical founding for predicting the responses of a habitat specialist to climate warming, and derived three predictions: i) changes in habitat availability affect top trophic levels, ii) linear changes in habitat availability generate nonlinear changes in distribution, and iii) the effects of environmental change on habitat can propagate upward and affect higher trophic levels. We used the Bicknell's thrush to illustrate changes in regional distribution. The Bicknell's thrush is a "threatened", patchily distributed bird species restricted to dense, high elevation balsam fir forests. We observed significant losses of suitable habitat patches under climate warming; moderate warming increased habitat amount in some regions, but intense warming had severe, negative effects. Our results imply important changes to the spatial structure of the species distribution. Changes in metapopulation persistence differed from those in habitat amount, suggesting that habitat amount alone is not enough to characterize regional distributional changes. Our results support the importance of integrating both habitat amount and landscape spatial structure in distribution modelling, for which metapopulation theory may be an ideal framework. We suggest that metapopulation models could increase the accuracy of distribution models and optimize conservation strategies."
